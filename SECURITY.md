## Version Support Guidelines

To ensure the security and stability of your PySNMP installation, please adhere to the following upgrade recommendations:

- **Always Upgrade to the Latest Patch Release**
  Patch releases address critical security vulnerabilities and bug fixes. Ensure you are using the latest patch version within your current major or minor release.
  *Example:* If you are on version 6.1.2, upgrade to 6.1.4.

- **Upgrade to the Next Minor Release Within 6 Months**
  Minor releases include new features and improvements. Upgrade to the latest minor version within 6 months after a new minor release is available to continue receiving security updates.
  *Example:* After 6.2.0 is released, upgrade to the latest 6.2.x within 6 months.

  > Note that our plan is to reduce this from 6 months to 3 months for 7.1.0 and above.

- **Upgrade to the Next Major Release Within 1 Year**
  Major releases may introduce significant changes and new functionalities. Upgrade to the latest major version within 1 year after a new major release to maintain support and security updates.
  *Example:* After 7.0.0 is released, upgrade to 7.x.x within 1 year.

### Recommended Upgrade Path
